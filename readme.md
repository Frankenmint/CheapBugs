1. clone this onto a custom username repo to keep it easy - in order to host on github your username MUST match the firstpart of the repo.  

2. name the cloned repo: cheapbugs.github.io or whatever your brand name shall be.

3. That's it!  Modify the repo, but basically the URL should be live and hosting!

Pointing Your Domain to this:

Taken from here {https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/}

1. I've added the custom CNAME record on the Repo for cheapbugs.net!

2. Create an AName Record or an Alias Record on your domain name registrar site.  Have the A Record resolve to one of these Ip Addresses:

*192.30.252.153
*192.30.252.154 

Give it a few hours and the site should be live!
